# Instagram ADB Bot <img align="left" alt="Instagram" width="44px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/instagram.svg" />
Python script to automate likes inside Instagram android application. 

## Setup
For the script to run you need to have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer, and available as an environment variable.

I've tested this code only with a real android device.
Connect your device to the computer, and enable USB debug.

Once everything is connected, you should be able to identify the device with ADB.

Check that Instagram is installed on your device.
You have to be logged in for the bot to work properly.

Run the script from main.py.
